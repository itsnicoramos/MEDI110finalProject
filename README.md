# MEDI 110   Final Website Project  
### Author:  Nico Ramos  
### Student: Vancouver Island University

## Overview  
This project is a five-page static website created for the MEDI 110 (Introduction to Media production) final assignment.  
The purpose of the website is to use photography, place-based storytelling, and basic web design to explore how Vancouver and Nanaimo influence my creative process as a student and emerging developer.

The site blends visual storytelling, travel photography, reflections, and simple HTML/CSS layout to communicate how place and environment shape creativity.

## Website Structure

### 1. Home  
A welcome page introducing the project and setting the overall theme.  
It explains the purpose of the website and provides a starting point for navigation.

### 2. About YCD (Nanaimo & VIU)  
A section focused on Nanaimo and the Vancouver Island University campus.  
This page highlights everyday inspiration found in island life—nature, ocean views, campus atmosphere, and student routines.

### 3. Vancouver  
A gallery-style page featuring photography from downtown Vancouver.  
This section captures the city’s architecture, waterfront areas, and creative urban energy.

### 4. Exploring YVR  
A travel-themed page documenting the journey from Nanaimo Harbour to Vancouver.  
Although “YVR” is used informally to refer to the city, this section emphasizes movement, perspective, and the visual experience of exploring Vancouver from a creator’s point of view.

### 5. Extra (Behind the Scenes & Reflection)  
A bonus page containing behind-the-scenes photos, process notes, and reflections on the assignment.  
This page explains the creative decisions, challenges, and workflow behind building the website.

## Learning Reflection

This project allowed me to combine web design with digital media concepts.  
By capturing and selecting images, organizing them into a narrative structure, and presenting them through a website, I gained a deeper understanding of how media, place, and storytelling interact.

It also helped connect my technical interests in web development with creative expression.
