                <p>
                    Hi, I am <strong>Nico</strong>, a Computer Science student at 
                    <strong>Vancouver Island University</strong>. This website is part of my 
                    <strong>MEDI110</strong> final project, showcasing a creative journey 
                    across Vancouver through photography and storytelling.
                    My goal with this project is to explore how place, mood, and movement shape the 
                    way we create media. From quiet mornings on the VIU campus to rain or shine 
                    in downtown Vancouver, every image and section on this site reflects the 
                    experience of traveling, observing, and capturing the world as a student and 
                    emerging creator.
                </p>

                <h2>ABOUT NANAIMO & VIU</h2>
                <p>
                    Nanaimo may seem like a quiet island city, but it carries a deeper story that becomes part of
                    student life at VIU rain or shine. Once a coaltown in the 1850s built around the harbour. 
                    The city has grown into a peaceful place where nature and learning blend together. On campus, 
                    small moments shape our days: the white and black bunnies
                    wandering across the lawns, the calm view of Departure Bay from the top floor of the library,
                    and the feeling of studying while surrounded by forests and coastal air. These familiar scenes,
                    rooted in both history and daily routine, slowly become part of Nanaimo and VIU personal story  for 
                    students and people here.

                <p>
                    Vancouver offers a completely different energy that is fast, modern, and visually layered. The 
                     city began as a coastal trading hub in the late 1800s and grew quickly because of its harbour, 
                     rail connections, and its position on the Pacific. That mix of history and modern design shapes 
                     how the city feels today. Rain or shine, Vancouver creates its own atmosphere through movement, 
                     reflections, and shifting light. Downtown blends nature with architecture in a cinematic way: 
                     As someone who travels between the island and the city, I wanted to capture 
                    Vancouver in motion and show how its environment inspires creativity and ambition.

                    Traveling from Nanaimo to Vancouver always creates a shift in perspective. 
                    The moment the seaplane lifts off, you can feel the transition between two very 
                    different environments one quiet and natural, the other structured and fast. 
                    This section focuses on that movement, using photography to show the journey from 
                    one place  to another. Rain, clouds, and water become part of the experience, 
                    turning simple travel moments into visual stories that express how place influences 
                    emotion and creativity.

                    This page highlights the behind the scenes process of creating the project. 
                    Every photo required decisions about framing, lighting, and how to use the weather 
                    rather than fight it. The experience of moving through the city, capturing images, 
                    and building the website helped me understand how media shapes meaning. By combining 
                    my own photography with design, layout, and narrative, I discovered how much place, 
                    movement, and mood can influence visual storytelling.
